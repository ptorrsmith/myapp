# README
This is a sample Rails application from Docker for Rails Developers (PragProg).
It was generated using Docker without Ruby installed on the local machine.
We're using the app to discover the wonderful world of Rails with Docker!!

This README should ideally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
